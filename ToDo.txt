How to run my program:

1- Compile hAV, Installer, and UnInstaller projects
2- Insure that the resulted files are named: hAV.EXE, Setup.EXE, UnhAV.EXE respectively.
3- Put hAV.EXE and UnhAV.EXE in the Appender project folder, and then run the Appender project
4- Select hAV.EXE file in the first text box, and UnhAV.EXE in the second one. the "Out" text box will be automatically filled with the destination file name. Please leave it as it is (Data.hav). Press Start button.
5- A new file named Data.hav is created in the Appender folder. This file with the Setup.EXE file created in (step 1) are the final excutables. put them together in some folder and then run setup.


Notes:
- A new entry in "Add/Remove programs" applet in control panel is created, to help uninstall the product if you want.

-The program may change some of the registry entries to control the autorun feature, it's safe and well-tested and it's nothing to worry about. Also, all the changed entries will be restored back if you uninstall the program.

-The program can only run on WinXP because Vista has some restrictions on accessing the registry. the resolution is enabling the "Run as administrator" option from the file properties page.... but it still needs some work to fully acheive this when you use a setup program.

Update history:
1- It is now completely in English
2- String constants moved to resource file
3- Removed Do..Loop and DoEvents and replaced with Sleep() API or timers when needed
4- Updated Appender application


Finally, I hope my program helps keeping your computer safe from viruses
(as it does to mine)
